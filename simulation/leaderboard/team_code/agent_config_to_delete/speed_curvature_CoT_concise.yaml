                You are an autonomous driving vehicle controller. You must ensure that the vehicle follows traffic rules. 
                - Speed limit: 20 m/s
                - Goal: Reach the target location as quickly as possible while staying within the speed limit.
                - Avoid collisions: If a car is ahead, slow down or change lanes.
                {target_description}
                Describe how you would navigate the vehicle to reach the target. 
                Should it turn left, turn right, go straight, slightly adjust direction, accelerate, or decelerate?

                The target is {x_distance} meters to your {x_direction} and {y_distance} meters to your {y_direction}. 
                The target is not an endpointâ€”continue moving forward after reaching it.

                Generate the vehicle's desired speed and curvature for the next 5 timestamps, ensuring safe and efficient movement towards the target.
                - Speed (m/s): Range [0, 20]
                - Curvature (degree/m): Range [-180, 180]
                - Negative curvature = turning left
                - Positive curvature = turning right
                - Ensure traffic rule compliance
                - Numerical values must be integers.
                - Avoid collisions by slowing down or changing lanes.
