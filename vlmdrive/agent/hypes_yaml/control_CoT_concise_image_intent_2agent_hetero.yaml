                Generate the vehicle's steering, throttle, and brake boolean for the next 5 timestamps, ensuring safe and efficient movement towards the target.
                - steering: Range [-1, 1]
                - throttle: Range [0, 1]
                - brake boolean: {{True, False}}
                - Negative steering = turning left
                - Positive steering = turning right
                - Ensure traffic rule compliance
                - Avoid collisions by slowing down or changing lanes.
                Output MUST be a valid JSON structure with the key \"predicted_control_signal\" containing a list of 5 [steering, brake boolean] pairs.
